STLSoft 1.10 TODOs:
===================

* Documentation improvements        -   abandoned. Will be done for STLSoft 1.11
* Website                           -   deferred until STLSoft 1.11 released
* custom radix in integer_to_string -   abandoned for performance reasons, and obviated by new conversion functions (oct, dec, hex) in 1.10
* C++ 11/14 compatibility           -   partial; further coming in 1.11
